# There are two way to declare or define a function

<<comment

  There are two way to apply comments.
  For single line we just put the 
  hash symbol and then write commnt.

  for multiline we have two way .
  first we will put the (<<) symbol and
  then give an name and after the commnt completed 
  we put the name which is given after (<<) symbol.
  like this
  <<mycomment
     here the comments
  mycomment   
  

  
  Second way for that is we start commnt putting
  the (:â€˜) collon and the single qoute and when 
  the commnt is complete then (') we put
  the single qoute

  here  will do my comments.....

#second way

	echo "Hassan"
}
